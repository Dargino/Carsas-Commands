# Contributing Guide

## Note From Repository Owner
Hello, as you may know by now, I (Carsa), no longer play Stormworks so updates are unlikely and bug fixes will be challenging, if even attempted. I will however remain involved with maintaining the project here and on the Steam Workshop.

This guide should help anyone willing to help keep this project alive

---

## New contributor guide
- You will want to have a good understanding of **Stormworks** Lua, as it differs from your typical Lua. It is missing metatables and has various other odd limitations.

- Take a look over the [main lua file](https://github.com/carsakiller/Carsas-Commands/blob/main/Carsa's%20Commands.lua)
