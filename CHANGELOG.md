# CHANGELOG

#### -- V1.01 --
-	Fixed error when attempting to heal a player that is not on the server.
- Corrected punctuation for `?player_perms` command.
- Disabling "map teleport" ("Allow Teleport" in the custom options menu) prevents non admin/owner players from teleporting.

- Added `?deny_tp` command that blocks another player from teleporting to you (Admins can override this).
